# STACKS & QUEUES

`Stacks` follow the rule of `LIFO` to mean `Last In, First Out` or `FILO` to mean `First In, Last Out`.
Stacks have one opening called the `top` where all the elements are passed, the method `LIFO`.

## Functions involved

### `Stacks`

- `pop()`: is used to delete/access an element
- `push()`: is used to add an element
- `isEmpty()`: check if the stack is empty
- `peek()`: return the top most element

`Queues` follow the rule of `FIFO` to mean `First In, First Out` or `LILO` to mean `Last In, Last Out`.
Queues have two openings, `front` and `rear` where by the first element to enter the queue is the first to leave the queue.

### `Queue`

- `enqueue()`: add an element
- `dequeue()`: remove an element
